# GSoC 2019 proposal for Allpix Squared
This is a temporary repository for files necessary for preparation of my GSoC 2019 proposal for Allpix Squared.

Files and their content:
- _task_one_report.pdf_ - my report on the first test task
- _gsoc_task_one.conf_ - configuration of the test simulation
- _gsoc_task_one_detector.conf_ - configuration for three mimosa26 detectors
- _gsoc_modules.root_ - resulting diagrams

I have not uploaded the output file of ROOTObjectWriter, because it is rather big for keeping it in the git history. 
Nevertheless, I can upload the file later if required.
